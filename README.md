# Statistical_Analysis

DataProcessing class contains several methods for analyzing precipitation stations

Methods which we can use:
1) General information about all stations, maximum and minimum year period
2) Showing statistics (mean, max, standart deviation)
3) Seeing missing values percentage
4) Testing distributions and finding best fitting probablity distibution (normal , lognormal, gamma, loggamma)
5) Changing missing values to median of months column
6) Choosing stations with minimum year period and percentage of missing values
7) 7 stationarity test
8) Homogeneity Tests

5 Homogeneity tests are 
1) Standard Normal or Ratio  test
2) Von - Neumann Ratio test
3) Cumulative_deviation
4) Bayesian_statistic
5) Pettit_test

I show all methods with an example in jupyter notebook. 
More information about the test you can see.
